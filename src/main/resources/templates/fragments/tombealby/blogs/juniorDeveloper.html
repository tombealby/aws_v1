      <h2>Junior Developer Saves The Day</h2>

      <p class="summary">My first programming job was with the logistics company Kuehne and Nagel. I worked
      on software systems that tracked the movement of goods around the world. I was lucky to get the job. The other
      developers were very nice and the company treated me well.</p>

      <p class="summary">In those early days I was very keen to learn. I arrived to work early and was often
      the last to leave. On one such occasion, when I was alone in the office in the evening, a phone started
      ringing. I ignored it to start with, but the phone kept on ringing. Eventually I picked up the call. It was
      a lady from the IT Support Helpdesk. There was a serious problem with the Canadian invoicing system. The system
      was meant to run overnight. But today it was crashing immediately on start up. It was a critical system.
      She needed someone to look into it straight away. Could I take a look? We agreed that I would do an initial
      investigation and get back to her.</p>

      <p class="summary">I had never worked on the invoicing system before. However it soon became obvious that it was
      a highly complex system. There were many programs calling each other. The programs were very large. They had many
      subroutines, loops and GOTO commands. It looked like a nightmare! I tried unsuccessfully to reproduce the problem
      on my local machine. I had no idea of what might be causing the problem in Canada.
      </p>

      <p class="summary">I called the support lady back. I explained what I had done. The lady suggested I try
      debugging the system in the production Canadian environment. This was a surprise. I had the attitude that it was
      best to avoid going near production with a barge pole. However she persuaded me that it would be ok. It was unlikely I
      could make things worse than they currently were.</p>

      <p class="summary">I started the production code, stepping through the code with the debugger, little by little.
      I expected to see the system crash out very soon. If I could see where it crashed, I might be able to understand
      what was happening. However the system didn't crash. It was just running from one break point to the next. I
      began increasing the gap between breakpoints. Surely it would crash out soon? But no, the system continued to run,
      printing invoices as if nothing was wrong. After a while, I decided to remove all breakpoints and just
      let the code run. I then waited for the crash. But still no crash occurred.</p>

      <p class="summary">I rang back the support lady. I explained that I had left the system running in debug mode. I
      said that it was creating invoices correctly at the moment, but, because I hadn't fixed anything, it was likely it
      would crash out soon. What did she want me to do next? She told me to leave it for now, but that it would need
      looking at first thing the next day.</p>

      <p class="summary">Next morning I arrived at work expecting all hell to be let loose. I was expecting all hands
      to the deck, fixing the invoicing problem. But instead all appeared normal. There was no mad panic. It seemed that
      nothing unusual was happening at all. It turned out that the invoicing system had continued to run all night. Everything
      had worked as required.</p>

      <p class="summary">I never did find out what caused the problem. I speculated afterwards that it was caused by a
      timing issue. Programs run slower in debug mode. Was it possible that by running things slower, some problem event was
      given time to complete? I really don't know.</p>

      <p class="summary">So that's how I fixed invoicing as a junior developer. It was 99% luck.</p>
