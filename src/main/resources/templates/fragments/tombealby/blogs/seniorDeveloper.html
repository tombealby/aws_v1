      <h2>Lessons Learnt As A Senior Developer</h2>

	  <h4>I Never Wanted To Be A Manager</h4>
      <p class="summary">I never chased a management position. In fact I took the opposite view. I was happy doing my
      own work as a mid-level developer. I enjoyed solving challenging technical problems and learning how software
      systems worked. I was happy to avoid the hassle of dealing with people.</p>
      <p class="summary">After many years developing, an opportunity arose, for me to move to a senior level.
      The rewards for the role were such that I felt compelled to try the role. I passed the interview and started the job.
      However the first year was tough. I faced many unexpected challenges. I made plenty of mistakes. What follows
      are some of the lessons that I learnt.</p>

      <h4>Prioritise your work</h4>
      <p class="summary">As a senior developer you will get multiple requests for your time. You won't be able to do
      everything at once. It is therefore essential to have a system for prioritising work. I keep a spreadsheet. Any
      request for me to do something goes into the spread sheet. Often requests don’t need immediate responses. As long
      as the request is in the spreadsheet and gets addressed at some suitable point then its fine. The spreadsheet will
      also show when you are becoming overloaded with work. When this happens discuss with your scrum master as to who
      can take some of the work off you. It took me a while to appreciate how important is is to prioritise work.
      I found that the simple spreadsheet system made me feel in control and greatly reduced my stress.</p>

      <h4>You Will Get Less 'Me Time Coding'</h4>
      <p class="summary">The multiple demands on your time mean that the time you spend developing will reduce dramatically.
      Perhaps you will need to take on about 50% less development work than you did before. Similarly you will need to
      accept that some of the more interesting development jobs are probably not suitable for you any more. These are the
      types of jobs that need some significant uninterrupted time to work on. You won’t get the luxury of such uninterrupted
      time. Also you should expect to do more code reviews and less actual coding.</a></p>

      <h4>You Don't Know Everything. You Won't Be Making All The Technical Decisions</h4>
      <p class="summary">Remember as a senior developer, you won't know the answers to everything. Its fine to say that
      you don't know and that you will get back with an answer. Also you are not responsible for taking the high level
      technical decisions. This is going to be a group activity with the architect taking the lead role. You participate
      and help in arriving at the decision. But it is no more your responsibility to make that decision than other
      experienced members in the team.</p>

      <h4>Be Careful About How You Help Others</h4>
      <p class="summary">Be careful how you help less experienced developers. You will be asked for help when other
      developers get stuck. The temptation is just to fix their issue because that is the quickest way. However that
      is not the quickest way in the long term. For the long term it is better to guide the other developer to find
      the solution. That way, the other developer learns how to approach the problem differently. They will learn new
      skills. This will mean that they don’t need so much help from you in the future. It helps if you enjoy helping
      others in this way.</p>

 	  <h4>Don't Worry About Whether Others Like You</h4>
      <p class="summary">Do not try to be popular or liked or to please other team members. Just act fairly and honestly.
      Whether other team members like you is out of your control, and something you shouldn’t be concerned about.
      If you are successful it is likely that some people will view you as fair game to be shot at. Try to assess
      whether the criticisms of you are fair. If they are fair then its an opportunity to learn and improve. Sometimes
      criticisms can be unfair. In that case then it is a back handed compliment. Remember no one kicks a dead dog.</p>
